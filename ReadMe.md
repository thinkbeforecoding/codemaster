# Code Master

This is a solver for [Code Master](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/code-master/), a game to learn programming logic.

Being stuck with my son at the 49th level, we decided that solving it by programming a solver was not cheating.

It's in F# to enable quick iterations. It's only pure functional code for easier
reasoning.

We also tried to make level input as close as possible from what we find in the game leaflet.
